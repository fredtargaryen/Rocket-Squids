# Rocket-Squids
A [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) mod all about fire-breathing super squids!

* Rocket Squids generate uncommonly in small groups. They are capable of swimming, singing, being tickled, and occasionally blasting off at great speeds... among other things.
* The Whistling Conch is a seashell generating on beaches and the sea floor. To my knowledge, the first musical instrument item in Minecraft.
* Rare and mysterious statues can be found in the world and may contain unusual treasure.

## Information for Players and Pack Developers
The intention of the mod is to encourage exploration and experimentation. As such very little information is explicitly provided in-game.
For hints at what to do, it is best to consult [the wiki](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rocket-squids/pages/main), which provides information in sections of increasing explicitness.
If you are still not satisfied, you can peruse the source code, but prepare to be spoiled on other content.

## Information for mod developers
### Compatibility with your mod
For your mod to work with Rocket Squids, add it as a dependency following the instructions [here](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle/wiki/Dependencies). 

If you want the dependency to be optional, you can check if Floocraft was loaded with `Loader.isModLoaded("rocketsquidsft")`.

You can find the latest Rocket Squids files [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rocket-squids/files).

I am not planning on designing any APIs or other compatibility features but will look into compatibility bugs or requests.

### Pull Requests
Any pull requests are very welcome. There are currently no standards for pull requests but clean code which
follows the existing patterns is appreciated. If you are making a new feature, consider messaging me first to see if I will accept it!
